In this readme file I will just add the important things i learned and I stuck at finding

Most important these are just assignments/projects so there will not be anything which tell you how can you setup this project

If you are a developer then you already know how can you set it up locally

From the above mdn docs i came to know about taking the raw body and I guess it will help me to take the rating of user which are in decimal
Cause I haven't done that yet but I think decimal number is removed while coming even though I can use it as string and convert it to num but still it is good to know
