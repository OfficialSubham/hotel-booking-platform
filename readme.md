In this readme file I will just add the important things i learned and I stuck at finding

Most important these are just assignments/projects so there will not be anything which tell you how can you setup this project

If you are a developer then you already know how can you set it up locally

LINK -> https://medium.com/@alan.norman.mail/decimal-numbers-with-trailing-zeros-and-raw-body-in-node-js-f7d8c4e7df10

From the above mdn docs i came to know about taking the raw body and I guess it will help me to take the rating of user which are in decimal
Cause I haven't done that yet but I think decimal number is removed while coming even though I can use it as string and convert it to num but still it is good to know

-------- Final verdict ------------

Okay after completing this project this is my final verdict and the things i learned from this project

First the things i learned

- About Tsup (Which help to build typescript file and we don't even have to import from .ts file)
- Building apis
- using --create-only while migrating the db cause I didn't know how to do check in prisma
- global error handling
- about require role middleware
- using default value in zod
- a lot of checks before sending the responses
- also learned about decimal number storing in db
- Still have to figure out why my backend converts it to string while sending

So the summary is I actually learned a lot of things from this project and i will also learn a lot from my upcomming project but before that I think I will again create this project in bun and bun seems to be faster than node i saw it while testing
It also runs ts files directly so i actully don't have to compile and run everytime

If you are checking this I know there are some problems in there even though I passed all the test I actually didn't follow the id type should be string but i used it as number by default which is generated by database itself so on the upcoming project i will do it using nano or crypto id if it is said in the assignment so i had done some tweks in the tests itself like changes some id like "some_id" to "1212121"

Except that nothing had changed Thank you for reading
